The trust’s work is informed by the health promotion model – that is in providing information to people to help empower them to take charge of their own health behaviours. The basis for this is The Ottawa Charter and [The Jakarta Declaration](http://ldb.org/iuhpe/jakdec.htm#%3CNo%20anchors%20found%3E). To reference this in a New Zealand context we refer you to [The Health Promotion Forum](http://hauora.co.nz/).

Programme content is drawn from extensive current national and international mental health promotion and educational research.

Our programmes are:

* Free to recipients, enabling participation.
* Designed to complement schools’ongoing health programmes, using drama as a tool for learning.
* Ideally placed to work within the Health Promoting Schools framework and other programmes.

The Trust also has an Artistic Consultation Group. Although we are not a bi-cultural theatre company per se, we are committed to understanding and working with the Treaty of Waitangi and tängata whenua of Aotearoa. We are also commited to addressing issues of Mãori and Pacific Island health in a positive, non-judgemental and affirming way.
