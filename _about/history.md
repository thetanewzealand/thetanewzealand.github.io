In 1989 the then Health Department made funding available to all area health boards for the prevention of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). Using theatre as an educational tool in health promotion was the brainchild of Viv Graham from the Otago Area Health Board’s Health Promotion Service. In late 1989 she discussed her ideas with people prominent in Dunedin’s professional theatre and with the help of the one-off Health Department grant, commissioned Karen Elliot to write and direct a safer sex programme for 16 to 18 year old secondary school students. This was written in association with Marc Metzger with input from a variety of public health professionals.

The Southland Area Health Board also joined the project and from mid – February to the May school vacation in 1990, The Say No or Joe Show toured 30 of the 43 secondary schools in Otago and Southland. Approximately 4,400 students participated in the programme and the evaluations were extremely positive from students, teachers and health professionals.

Following the programme’ success, Viv Graham and Karen Elliot investigated continuing theatre in health education in Otago/Southland and possibly further afield.

A planning process began which included a national survey of health educators in schools, area health boards and other health agencies for their views on theatre as an educative tool. The theatre in health education company, Brainstorm Productions, in New South Wales, Australia was also visited.

Evaluation of the information gathered from all these sources made it clear that theatre would be welcomed as a tool and could be complementary to comprehensive and long term health education within schools, supported by audio-visual and written material produced by health agencies. Priority programmes such as alcohol and other drug misuse, smoking prevention, nutrition – in fact any and all health related issues could all incorporate a theatre component. As a result of this, the Theatre in Health Education Trust (THETA) was formally established in November 1991.

The inaugural Trustees were Karen Elliot, Viv Graham, Pat Harrison (secondary school principal), Hilary Norris(actor/director/theatre teacher) and Dr Peter Strang (Otago University Student Health Service).
