The evaluation explored how well THETA’s Sexwise programme met the specifications of its funder, the Ministry of Health, which are:

* to build students’ knowledge, understanding and attitudes
* to fit in with and add value to the school curriculum
* to engage with national and local agencies
* to impact positively on teacher and parent knowledge
* to demonstrate cultural competency

'The research found that the Sexwise programme focuses on relationship skills, uses interactive methods and allows students to personalise what they learn. The company draws on an Applied Theatre approach that aims for the audience to engage in the story in ways that prioritise emotional safety while at the same time allowing students to identify with characters and alter their thinking and behaviour.' 'The research showed how the performance and workshops covered key areas of sexuality education agreed with the Ministry of Health: relationship development, delay and abstinence, sexually transmitted infections and diverse sexuality.'
