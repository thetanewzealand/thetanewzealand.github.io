**Ma te whakatau, - ka mohio,**

**Ma te mohio - ka mãrama,**

**Ma te mãrama - ka matau,**

**Ma te matau - ka ora**

The Theatre in Health Education Trust (THETA) provides innovative and challenging health education programmes to the rangatahi/youth of Aotearoa-New Zealand through the experiential medium of theatre.

Our interactive theatre-based programmes use a combination of traditional theatre, educational drama, structured role play and decision-making activities to engage students in the exploration of issues relevant to their lives.
