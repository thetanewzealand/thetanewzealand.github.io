Crunch and Munch is a resource designed to complement your ongoing food and nutrition health education programme. Teacher preparation and follow-up will enhance its effectiveness. THETA provides written resources to help enable this. Programme content is current and is drawn from a variety of professional health sources.



## CRUNCH AND MUNCH
… is ideally placed to complement the Healthy Eating – Healthy Action Implementation Plan in the Ministry of Health’s Cancer Control Strategy, and to enhance existing nutrition strategies from other providers, for example 5+ a Day.

This simple, participatory programme could easily be used as:

a staging point for the initiation of Health Promoting Schools projects
a reiteration of the nutrition strategy in schools already participating in the project
a motivational learning tool to enhance studies in food and nutrition
LINKS TO THE FOOD AND NUTRITION EDUCATION KEY AREA OF LEARNING IN THE HEALTH AND PE CURRICULUM
The Crunch and Munch presentation aims to enable students to:

 Express their ideas, needs and feelings confidently when making simple changes in food choices (C3)  Describe their feelings and ask questions about the role that food plays in their health and well-being (A1)  Contribute to an environment where healthy eating is supported and encouraged (D1)  Describe their nutritional needs for growth and development (2A1)  Describe how, when selecting and preparing foods, individuals and groups share characteristics but are also unique (2C2)
These learning intentions are specifically linked to the Achievement Objectives at Levels 1 and 2 of the Health and Physical Education in New Zealand curriculum document. Links have also been made to the Wellbeing strand in Te Whãriki.

Teachers may use the performance as a learning focus to enhance their programmes for their students at any level within the target range.



## THETA
THETA supports the framework of the “Health and Physical Education Curriculum” and is committed to working in partnership with New Zealand schools and health providers.

Recognising best practice models as well as the holistic framework of the Curriculum, THETA aims to integrate its programmes into schools’ existing health education strategies. Much of the effectiveness of THETA’s programmes is lost if they are implemented without this integration.

THETA recommends that students will be served best by the use ofCrunch and Munch as only one resource alongside others in the health education programme they are currently participating in.

Other school health education programmes which are relevant to those from THETA are sexual health; tobacco; alcohol and other drug issues; self esteem; relationship building; assertiveness skill development.

THETA is a member of the New Zealand Health Teachers’ Association; Health Promoting Schools; NZAAHD
