Sexual health programme for secondary school students

![Image](/img/sex_wise.jpg)

## Description

THETA currently has an agreement with the Ministry of Health to deliver Sexwise:

To rangatahi/youth across New Zealand in Year 9 - 13 schools and alternative education. A focus on North Island low decile (1-6) schools and schools with a high percentage of Māori and Pacific Island students.

2019 marks the 30th year THETA’s programmes have been participated in by rangatahi/youth in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Check out the Sexwise website [here](http://www.sexwise.nz/).

Theatre Component (one period)
A performance with songs, humour and drama. It focuses on four ‘typical’ high school teens and follows their developing relationships. Unresolved questions in the narrative are carried over to the workshop, during which your students discuss issues and behaviours and provide real advice to the fictitious characters.
This component is for the combined group of classes who will also receive the workshop that day.
Workshop Component (one period)
Interactive theatre based activities that promote questioning and discussion, enabling students to explore and reflect on behaviour that impacts on sexual health and wellbeing.
It is essential that all students participating in the programme attend this workshop.
To maximise participation each workshop is limited to 40 students.

## CREATING SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS
THETA recognises that we will be your guests and that your school is ultimately responsible for your health education programme. We support schools to use Sexwise as part of an integrated approach that enhances delivery of the sexual health component of the The New Zealand Curriculum. Sexwise will encourage meaningful communication between students, their Family and Whānau, the school community, and local health providers.

Please note that Sexwise may trigger unresolved personal issues in some participants. It is an expectation that all settings who accept Sexwise also have robust policies and processes in place to support students to be able to disclose sexual violence safely and sensitively. The actors presenting Sexwise have received guidance around managing disclosures and will refer students on to support services within the school in the first instance. They are not trained counsellors.

Consultation with Family and Whānau
Should you request it during registration, a preview of Sexwise may be held for Family and Whānau, Boards of Trustees, Staff and the wider school community before students participate in the programme. A preview requires the school to actively promote attendance at an evening event, of usually ninety minutes to two hours duration.
THETA recommends that schools consult with parents / caregivers before and after Sexwise You may take photos of the performance for your school newsletter etc.

## DEVELOPING PERSONAL SKILLS
Sexwise links to the Sexuality Education Key Area of Learning in the Health and Physical Education Curriculum and the values, key competencies and principles of The New Zealand Curriculum, which promotes the vision of helping young people to be confident, connected, actively involved lifelong learners.

The Sexwise performance and workshop aims to initiate student recognition of, and discussion about:
